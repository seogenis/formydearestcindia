You were my home and made me homeless-core.\n I\'ve been debugging the pet today since 7 pm, which was... fuck 10 hours ago. holy shit. the IOS system is bitching about my code(hence why I like Windows better...), so the pet would have to wait a day or more... my b my b\n It was a shame that things turned bitter... I did a lot of reflecting today and remembered how much great memories we\'ve made together and how amazing you are. I have no idea how our relationship will look like in the future, but nevertheless, I wish you a happy Valentines!! I love you!!(as a friend?) You deserve flowers and chocolates and gifts and kisses more than anyone \n --for my dearest Cindia');
